   <br> <p>Death's Door is a 2021 action-adventure video game developed by Acid Nerve and published by Devolver Digital. It was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on July 20, 2021. It received positive reviews upon release, with several publications praising its mechanics, simplicity, and difficulty level, likening it to the Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls games.</p>
<h2 id=intro>Gameplay</h2>
<img class=DDBanner src="DeathsDoorGamePlay.jpg" alt="Death's Door Gameplay image">
<p>Death's Door is a 3D, isometric, action-adventure game.  The player starts with a sword and bow and arrow. Sword strikes string together into combos and ammo for the bow is replenished by using the sword. Four other weapons and three magic projectiles become available as the game progresses, but the basic attack mechanics remain. At the start, the player has four health points, with all damage causing one to be depleted. Health is recovered by collecting and planting seeds in pots which appear throughout the world. The seeds grow into plants which restore full health and eventually regrow. Doors to and from the afterlife area exist as checkpoints throughout the game. When the player dies, they respawn at the nearest door without otherwise losing progress. As with other Zelda-like games, new items and abilities allow access to new areas in previously explored levels, and solving puzzles with available tools is required to complete dungeons. The game uses souls as a currency, collected by killing enemies and finding secret pick-ups, which can be used to upgrade basic abilities.</p>
    <h2 id=intro>Plot</h2>
<p>The player takes on the role of a small crow who works as a "reaper" collecting souls for the Reaping Commission Headquarters, an office-like bureaucratic afterlife. For the first mission of the game, the character is sent to collect the soul of a monster who does not want to leave life willingly. After defeating it, a large, old crow intervenes and steals the soul before telling of a potential conspiracy regarding the disappearance of other crows. The old crow explains that the player must make their way through three dungeons in order to collect three "Giant Souls" needed to open Death's Door. Throughout the game, more information is revealed about the Reaping Commission's background and leader, the Lord of Doors. Using an array of weapons, projectiles, magic, and dodging, the player travels through several areas, all of which link back to Headquarters via a door, defeating three bosses to collect Giant Souls.</p>
<p> <strong>Spoilers below!</strong> (click to reveal)</p>
<div class=spoiler tabindex=0>Upon unlocking the door, the player learns that the bureaucracy was created when Death entered into an arrangement with the first Lord of Doors to process souls on Death's behalf in exchange for extending the life of the Lord of Doors until they appoint a successor. Instead of appointing a successor and accepting the end of their life, the current Lord instead imprisoned Death behind the door in order to gain immortality. The final boss fight is with the Lord of Doors, after which the bureaucracy is dismantled. After the credits, the player can switch to night mode and solve puzzles in each of the levels to collect Tablets of Knowledge which unlock the true ending.</div>
<h2 id=intro>Reception</h2>
<p>Death's Door received <q>generally favorable</q> reviews according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Multiple reviewers likened its aesthetics to the Dark Souls games, but with a markedly lighter tone and gentler learning curve.<br> 
    <br>GameSpot's Alessandro Barbosa wrote that it <q>doesn't take itself too seriously, but it always finds interesting ways to make a point about the unending cycle of life and death, the pursuit of a means to unbalance that cycle, and ultimately the consequences of those actions.</q> It has been called a difficult game, but not punishing or sadistic. Its mechanics drew comparisons to the top-down Legend of Zelda games. Reviewers praised the game's relative simplicity, relying on tight mechanics common to the genre and a short overall playtime. <br>
    <br>PC Gamer's Luke Winkie criticized aspects of the level design, which necessitate more backtracking that should be required, but with an overall positive review: <q>It's as if a grand entry to an overarching canon—filled with quirks, humor, and wondrous attention to detail—was miraculously miniaturized to fit into a fortnight's worth of lunch breaks.</q><br> 
    <br>In a positive review, Brendan Graeber wrote in IGN that it <q>expertly blends classic dungeon puzzle solving with fast-paced combat encounters to create a memorable adventure across a moody world brimming with secret paths and hidden rewards.</q> <br>
    <br>Kotaku praised the developers' attention to detail and execution on the fundamentals of game design. Destructoid similarly said that while not the most original game, it does everything it sets out to do very well. Fenn also received praise for his compositions and sound design</p>
