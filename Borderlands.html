        <p>Borderlands is a 2009 open world action role-playing first-person looter shooter video game.
            It is the first game in the Borderlands series, developed by Gearbox Software, and published 
            by 2K Games for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, Mac OS X and Shield Android TV. The 
            game was released worldwide in October 2009, with the Mac OS X version being released on 
            December 3, 2010 by Feral Interactive. The game's story focuses on a group of four "Vault Hunters", 
            who travel to the distant planet of Pandora to search for the "Vault", which is rumored to contain advanced
             alien technology and other priceless riches. The hunters piece together clues to find the Vault while battling
              the savage wildlife of Pandora and the bandits and outlaws that populate the planet, ultimately banding together
               to prevent the Atlas Corporation and its privately-funded paramilitary forces from reaching the Vault first. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_(video_game)"> Wikipedia</a>)</p>

    <h2 id="blHeader">Gameplay</h2>
    <div id="blMain"><p>Borderlands includes character-building elements found in role-playing games, leading the developer Gearbox Software to call 
        the game a "role-playing shooter". At the start of the game, players select one of four characters, each with a unique special 
        skill and with proficiencies with certain weapons. From then on, players take on missions assigned through non-player 
        characters or from bounty boards, each typically rewarding the player with experience points, money, and sometimes a reward item.
        Players earn experience by killing both human and non-human foes and completing in-game challenges (such as getting a certain number
         of kills using a specific type of weapon). As they gain levels from experience growth, players can then allocate skill points into a
          skill tree that features three distinct specializations of the base character; for example, Mordecai can become specialized in 
          sniping, gunslinging with revolvers, or using his pet Bloodwing to assist in kills and health boosting. Players can distribute points 
          among any of the specializations, and can also spend a small amount of in-game money to redistribute their skill points.</p>
