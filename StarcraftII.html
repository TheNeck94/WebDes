        <p>
            StarCraft II is a military science fiction video game created by Blizzard Entertainment as a sequel to the successful StarCraft video game released in 1998. Set in a fictional future, the game centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among the various fictional races of StarCraft.

            StarCraft II single-player campaign is split into three installments, each of which focuses on one of the three races: StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (released 2010), Heart of the Swarm (2013) and Legacy of the Void (2015). A final campaign pack called StarCraft II: Nova Covert Ops was released in 2016.

            StarCraft II multi-player gameplay spawned a separate e-sports competition that later drew interest from companies other than Blizzard, and attracted attention in South Korea and elsewhere, similar to the original StarCraft e-sports.

            Since 2017, StarCraft II multi-player mode, co-op mode and the first single-player campaign have been Free-to-play.

    <h1 id="blHeader">The Story</h1>
    <div id="blMain">
        <p>The story of StarCraft II continues on the story of the original StarCraft releases, dealing with the races of StarCraft and characters of StarCraft.

    Wings of Liberty is set four years after the events of StarCraft: Brood War, and focuses on the conflict between Jim Raynor and Arcturus Mengsk. The Zerg reappear as a frequent foil, and Raynor ultimately recovers Kerrigan from the Zerg home world.

    In Heart of the Swarm, the Dominion attacks Raynor and Kerrigan, and the story mainly follows the exploits of Kerrigan, against Mengsk as well as new Protoss-Zerg hybrids.

    In Legacy of the Void, the Protoss are the protagonists, led by Zeratul and Artanis, fighting against the architect of the Protoss-Zerg hybrids, the evil Amon.

    In a short epilogue after the end of Legacy of the Void, all three factions join to confront Amon inside the Void.</p>
