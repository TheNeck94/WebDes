        In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,<br>
        For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met,<br>
        Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed,<br>
        A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.<br><br>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <img class="imageCenter" src="HollowKnightGameplay.jpg" alt="Gameplay Picture">
    <p class="quotedText">
        Beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth sleeps a vast, ancient kingdom. Many
        <br>are drawn beneath the surface, searching for riches, or glory, or answers to
        <br>old secrets.
        <br>As the enigmatic Knight, you'll traverse the depths, unravel its mysteries and
        <br>conquer its evils.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>The Knight can explore the large interconnected world of Hallownest using a variety of movement and combat techniques. In classic Metroidvania style, there are areas of the world that the Knight cannot access until they obtain particular Items or Abilities. Maps for each area must be bought from a shopkeeper generally hidden somewhere in that area, and the Knight can also buy upgrades that place markers on the map or allow them to reveal parts of the map as they explore. Many areas have a 'boss' enemy that the Knight must defeat in order to continue, and have a number of sub-bosses that drop useful rewards or upgrades.
        <br>
        <br>Defeated enemies drop Geo, a currency that the Knight can use to buy items from shopkeepers. If the Knight is killed, they respawn at the last place they rested and lose all their Geo. They must then return to their place of death and defeat their Shade in order to recover the currency. The Knight also gains SOUL by attacking enemies, which they can then spend to recover lost health or activate special abilities. Health can also be recovered at Hot Springs, which are located around the world, or by resting at a Bench.
    </p>
