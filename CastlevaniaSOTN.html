   <br> <p>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is an action role-playing game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation and is considered <strong>the</strong> defining Metroidvania game.  It was initially released in Japan on March 20th, 1997, in North America on October 2nd, 1997, and the rest of the world on November 1st, 1997.  It's most recent console release was in Castlevania Requiem for the PlayStation 4 on October 26th, 2018 with it's prequel Castlevania: Rondo of Blood.</p>
<h2 id=intro>Gameplay</h2>
<img class="CBanner" src="CastlevaniaGameplay.png" alt="Castlevania Gameplay Picture">

<p>Symphony of the Night introduced a more fluid control scheme for its protagonist. Unlike his predecessors, Alucard can back-dash with a single button, and attack with a downward kick while jumping. Alucard can also use Magic Spells learned through incantation scrolls and activated with specific button combinations. Some spells damage enemies, such as Hell Fire, while others heal Alucard, like Soul Steal and Dark Metamorphosis.
<br>
    <br>As in previous Castlevania titles, Alucard can use a variety of sub-weapons found in various places of the castle, such as the staple knives, axes, and holy water. Like earlier games, sub-weapons are powered by Hearts, which act as an ammunition count global to all sub-weapons, and only one sub-weapon can be equipped at a time.
    <br>
    <br>Alucard will learn skills when he discovers certain relics, a feature reused in later titles. Using these relics, Alucard is able to increase the potency of his jumping skills, gain the ability to open magically-sealed doors, travel painlessly through water and even transform into different animals, as well as an ethereal Mist Form.
    <br>
    <br>Symphony of the Night is the first Castlevania title since Simon's Quest to use RPG-like elements. Alucard can progress in levels, after gaining a specific amount of experience points. Every time Alucard "levels up", statistics such as attack power, defensive strength, and luck will increase. He can also find special items called "Life Max Ups" to increase his maximum hit points, "MP Max Ups" to increase max MP, and "Heart Max Ups" to increase the number of hearts he can carry. Alucard is able to restore his health or normal status using various potions and foodstuffs found in the castle, as well as special rooms that act as save points.
    <br>
    <br>Another RPG element in the game is the option to equip armor, accessories, and weapons for Alucard. Some may merely increase his power, while others make him resistant to certain elemental attacks, or immune to specific status effects. Alucard also has a huge variety of one-time use items at his disposal. While some may do damage to one enemy or a small group, others can be used to attack all enemies covering the screen.
    <br>
    <br>Alucard will be able to enlist the help of Familiars, which include the Faerie, Demon, Ghost, Bat, and Sword. All Familiars have the ability to level up as well, and become increasingly intelligent as their levels increase, making them attack or heal faster. Some may gain new abilities or even new appearances.</p>
<h2 id=intro>Plot</h2>
<p>The game's story takes place during the year 1797, 5 years after the events of Rondo of Blood and begins with Richter Belmont's defeat of Count Dracula, mirroring the end of the former game. However, despite Dracula being defeated, Richter vanishes without a trace. Castlevania rises again five years later, and while there are no Belmonts to storm the castle, Alucard, the son of Dracula, awakens from his self-induced sleep, and decides to investigate what transpired during his slumber.  <br>

<br>    Meanwhile, Maria Renard, Richter's sister-in-law, enters Castlevania herself to search for the missing Richter. She assists Alucard multiple times throughout the game. <br>

  <br> <strong>Spoilers below!</strong> (click to reveal) <br>
    <br> <div class="spoiler" tabindex="0">There are four separate endings to the story. If a certain sequence of events is followed, Richter is revealed to be under the influence of the dark priest Shaft. After the latter is defeated, an upside-down version of Castlevania, the Reverse Castle, appears from the heavens. This castle contains another entire series of adventures, crowned by the ultimate face-off between Alucard and his revived father, Dracula himself.</div> </p>
    <h2 id=intro>Reception</h2>
<p>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night received wide critical acclaim at the time of its release. Critics lauded the massive, free-to-explore game world with its numerous secrets to uncover, and praised the game for integrating role-playing elements without compromising the series' basic gameplay. Multiple critics also made mention of the ingeniously designed enemies and the story's many plot twists. GameSpot hailed it as <q>easily one of the best games ever released and a true testament to the fact that 2D gaming is not dead by any stretch of the imagination.</q> Computer and Video Games commented, <q>This may be old-skool style, but it feels like the freshest thing of the year.</q> Next Generation stated that <q>Symphony of the Night has classic written all over it</q> and called it <q>spectacular</q> for a 2D side-scrolling platformer in the age of 32- and 64-bit games. GamePro gave it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and fun factor), calling it <q>one of the best games of the year.</q>
<br>
    <br>Despite the popular consensus of the time that 2D had become outmoded, critics also highly praised the game's graphics for their smooth animation, impressive effects, and evocation of atmosphere. John Ricciardi of Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that <q>everything is animated with an amazing attention to detail, and the special effects used throughout provide an atmosphere that just begs to be experienced.</q> However, there were a few detractors of the use of 2D. Entertainment Weekly said that the visuals were dated and flat, when compared to Nightmare Creatures which featured 3D environments, while IGN commented, <q>The graphics are initially similar-looking to SNES and Genesis incarnations of the game, the character animation isn't particularly smooth and 3D is resigned to limited background effects and the odd special effect.</q> A few criticized the voice acting, though GameSpot instead praised it. The music was met with almost unanimous approval, IGN describing it as <q>sometimes daunting, sometimes rousing and always doing what music shouldâ€”enhancing the action.</q>
    <br>
    <br>In Electronic Gaming Monthly's Editors' Choice Awards, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was awarded <q>PlayStation Game of the Year</q> and <q>Side-Scrolling Game of the Year</q>, and was a runner-up for <q>Best Music</q> (behind PaRappa the Rapper) and <q>Game of the Year</q> (behind GoldenEye 007). It also was named <q>Best Sequel</q> in their annual Buyer's Guide. It was named <q>Game of the Year</q> by PSM in its list of the top ten games of 1997.
    <br>
    <br>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night received a nomination for <q>Adventure Game of the Year</q> at the inaugural AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards).
    <br>
    <br>The game has developed a large cult following and copies of the original PlayStation version are considered collector's items. It demonstrated the continued popularity of 2D games during the fifth generation of video game consoles in the 32-bit era, which saw rapid advancements in 3D gaming.
    <br>
    <br>The game has continued to receive critical acclaim, and it has appeared on several other <q>greatest game</q> lists. The same year it was released, it was ranked the 12th best console video game of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly, which said it <q>is not only the best 2-D game on the PlayStation, it's one of the best, period.</q> It appeared on GameSpot's <q>The Greatest Games of All Time</q> list. It was placed 16th on IGN's <q>Top 100 Games of All Time</q> and 24th in Game Informer's <q>Top 200 Video Games Ever</q>, down six places from its 2001 ranking. GameZone ranked it the best Castlevania title ever made. GamePro listed the discovery of the inverted castle as the 26th-greatest moment in gaming. GamesRadar named Castlevania: Symphony of the Night the second-best PlayStation game of all time, behind Metal Gear Solid. It was ranked 4th place on EGM's list of 100 greatest games of all time, and was the highest PS1 game on the list. Edge ranked the game No. 35 on its list of <q>The 100 Best Games To Play Today</q>, stating <q>When you get to that moment when the castle turns on its head, you see that it's a work of genius.</q>
    <br>
    <br>The gameplay of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and its 2D successors is often compared in the gaming press with the popular series Metroid, with both Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid seen as pioneers in the genre, leading to the coinage of the term <q>Metroidvania</q> (a portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania), used to describe video games that share some of their elements.</p>
